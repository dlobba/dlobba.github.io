## About
I am Diego Lobba, a computer science graduate student and
open source enthusiast.
I have a very broad set of interests involving the information
technology universe.

I am currently a research intern in the D3S Lab at the
University of Trento, where I
help the team developing outstanding MAC protocols for WSN
and IoT use cases.

I love to automate stuff like testing scripts or
to do text extraction for some further processing.
For these my tool of choice is usually Python.

You can find a glimpse of this by
looking at my repos. In this page instead
I try to add some presentations or resources, in general,
to present what I find to be cool about what I have done.

### Contacts

If you find a bug or have some fancy project in mind in which
you need my help, do not hesitate to contact me!
