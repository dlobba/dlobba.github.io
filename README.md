## About
I am Diego Lobba, I work at Navionics, a Garmin Company as software engineer
in the wonderful world of marine cartography.

Besides my position at Navionics, I am a computer science graduate
and open source enthusiast.

After my master in computer science I spent a year working as research intern
in the D3S Lab at the University of Trento, where I
helped the team developing outstanding MAC protocols for WSN
and IoT use cases.

I have a quite broad set of interests involving the information
technology universe.
I love to automate stuff like testing scripts or
fetching text for some further processing.
For these use cases my tool of choice is usually Python.
You can find a glimpse of this by
looking at my repos.

Nowadays, my daily duties include developing frontend interfaces using
the superb Qt widgets framework and writing modern C++ code.
