# About

*Hi there!*

I am Diego, rookie software developer turned devops practician.
I love coding, but I am especially interested in studying software
development in all its shades, forms and phases.

My journey has brought me (almost) to the bare metal, devising
custom protocols for wireless sensor networks derived from top-notch
academia findings.

I then raised the focus to application development for hand-held devices
displaying cartographic content and had the opportunity to first-hand grasp the
tight connection between software and data.

Nowadays I am looking at the big picture of software systems as a devops engineer,
orchestrating microservices through Kubernetes deployments on AKS platform.

## For those interested in my background

My journey, similarly to many others, began with the love
for video games and the aspiration to become a game developer,
which motivated me enough to pursue first my bachelor at the University of Milan,
and later my master degree in computer sciences, at the University of Trento.

During both the undergraduate and graduate courses, I got
fascinated by everything that was *close to the metal* and
had the fantanstic chance to get involved with development
of firmware protocols for wireless sensor networks.
After my master I cultivated this interest for one more
year working as research intern in the D3S Lab at the
University of Trento, where I helped the team developing
outstanding MAC protocols for WSN and IoT use cases.

Determined to see more complex embedded systems I landed my first job
at Navionics, now Garmin Italy Technologies, as software engineer
in the wonderful world of marine cartography hand-held devices.
The job got me moving again, this time to the wonderful town of Lucca, in Tuscany.
There, the focus moved from the firmware to the application development
and its link with data embedded in charts.  
The experience was shockingly good, on the one hand I had the chance
to work on code bases that were older than me and crafted by top-notch
engineers, on the other hand I could broaden my view besides computer
programs intended as a artifacts per se, but as an interaction medium to other
sources.  
Circumstaces made me leave coding as a secondary exercise to give
focus on more organizational aspects of software development.
Despite being an interesting exercise I was not ready for the assignment yet,
and even less to give up on coding as my primary duty.
I therefore decided to find new opportunities.

My next step moved me back to my origins, in the small swiss town of
Novazzano close to the italian border and especially close to my hometown, Como.  
There I joined Inpeco as a devops engineer, worldwide renown player in
the healthline automation market.  
Being a low-level coder I was particularly scared of this role,
but during my time at Garmin Italy Technologies I had the chance
to get a feeling of how much work it takes to make software developers
do their job in terms of infrastructure and company services, I therefore
decided not to ignore this oppurtunity and it is going tremendously good so far :)

... and it is all for this time around!  
If your reached this point, I really thank you for taking
the time to read my story.

Greetings from Italy,  
Diego
