## About
I am Diego Lobba, a master student at University of Trento.
I have a very broad set of interests involving the information
technology universe.

Currently I am interested in the topic of
wireless sensor networks and distributed systems.
Other than this, I love to automate stuff like testing scripts or
to do text extraction for some further processing.
For these my tool of choice is usually Python.

You can find a glimpse of this by
looking at my repos. In this page instead
I try to add some presentations or resources, in general,
to present what I find to be cool about what I have done.

### Contacts

If you find a bug or have some fancy project in mind in which
you need my help, do not hesitate to contact me!
